I am Frontend Developer based out of Pasadena, CA.
I currently work as a Frontend developer at QLess Inc. where I create user interfaces for our applications, write lots of JavaScript, and work to improve developer culture by encounrage our team to âœ¨learn in publicâœ¨. 
Many of the projects that I work on a daily basis are for my company, so my side projects are a bit sparse, though I do love playing new tools and technologies when I have a chance.

ðŸŒ± Here are somethings I want to learn in 2021:
- React Query
- GraphQL
- âœ… Tailind 
- XState
- Redux
