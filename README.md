I am Developer based out of Pasadena, CA.
I currently work as an Internal tools developer at Bolt.com where I create user interfaces for our applications, write lots of Typescript, and push others to improve internal tooling.
Many of the projects that I work on a daily basis are for my company, so my side projects are a bit sparse, though I do love playing new tools and technologies when I have a chance.
