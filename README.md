ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Abdul â€” a full-stack developer based in Pasadena, CA.

I work at Bolt, where I build user interfaces, improve developer experience and champion better tooling across the company. I mostly write TypeScript and Go, and I spend a lot of time thinking about making dev workflows smoother and systems more reliable.
Most of my work is behind the scenes (and behind a VPN), but I try to carve out time to explore new tools, frameworks, and obscure parts of the web platform. Always down to learn, experiment, and refactor something bothering me for weeks. Mostly I just want to ride my bike.
